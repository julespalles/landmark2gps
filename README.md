# Geo-location Prediction via Landmarks
This tool derives the GPS coordinates at which a video (in Delft) was taken. 

It does this by extracting [SIFT features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform) from the input video, and matching these to a labelled database of landmarks in Delft. The matching is done using [RANSAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample_consensus).

## Running the code
